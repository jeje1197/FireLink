1) Click the "sign in" button. It should open a popup window prompting you to login in to a Google account.
2) Login to your google account. Once you are signed in, the popup window should close on its own and the landing page will load.
3) You should see a chat room with messages on the left (representing messages from other users) and messages
on the right (these are your messages). Since it's your first time visiting the chat site, there will not be any messages displayed on the right.
To send a message, type something into the textbox at the bottom of the page and click the send button.
4) Your message will soon appear on the right side of the screen. If you examine it, you will find a timestamp from when the message was sent.
To edit or delete one of your messages, select a message by clicking on it. This should make the message slide over revealing an "edit" button and
a "x" button. The chat room will update.
6) If you want to sign out, click the "sign out" button at the top left of the chatroom. This will sign you out of the application.
